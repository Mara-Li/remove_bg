Simple website that use React and Jimp to remove the white background under an image.

i really dont understand why no simple website do that... like why i should use ai and paid for such a simple task ??

No AI, all is local. The image can be pasted in the block. Result is send into your clipboard of you can download it.

it sucks. i know.
